# Chapter 4: Design and Implementation of the Authorization Report Tool

## 4.1 Introduction

The design and implementation phase of software development is a critical juncture where conceptual ideas are transformed into functional systems. This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of how the Authorization Report Tool was conceived, designed, and brought to life. This tool, aimed at automating the analysis of Spring Security configurations in Java applications, represents a significant advancement in enhancing the security posture of web applications by providing developers and security professionals with comprehensive insights into their authorization mechanisms.

The Authorization Report Tool was developed with several key objectives in mind:

1. To accurately identify and catalog all endpoints within a Spring-based web application, providing a comprehensive view of the application's API surface.
2. To meticulously analyze the security configurations applied to these endpoints, including authentication methods, authorization rules, and custom security filters.
3. To generate clear, actionable reports that developers and security professionals can use to improve their application's security stance.

This chapter will delve deep into how these objectives shaped the tool's architecture, influenced key design decisions, and guided the implementation process. We will examine the system's architecture in great detail, exploring the core components and their interactions. Each major component will be dissected, revealing its internal workings, the rationale behind its design, and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the tool.

## 4.2 System Architecture

### 4.2.1 High-Level Architecture

The Authorization Report Tool is designed with a modular architecture, consisting of three main modules:

1. auth-report-cli: The command-line interface module
2. auth-report-core: The core functionality module
3. auth-report-spring: The Spring-specific integration module

This modular structure was chosen after careful consideration of several architectural patterns. The decision to separate the tool into these three modules was driven by the following factors:

1. Separation of Concerns: Each module has a distinct responsibility, which enhances maintainability and allows for independent evolution of different aspects of the tool.
2. Reusability: The core functionality is isolated in the auth-report-core module, allowing it to be potentially reused in different contexts or integrated with different front-ends in the future.
3. Framework Independence: By separating the Spring-specific code into its own module, the core analysis logic remains framework-agnostic, opening possibilities for future adaptations to other frameworks.

The auth-report-core module serves as the central component, containing the main logic for scanning, analysis, and report generation. It defines the core data structures and interfaces used throughout the tool. This module is designed to be independent of any specific framework or interface, ensuring its flexibility and potential for reuse in different contexts.

The auth-report-cli module provides the command-line interface, interacting with the core module to initiate scans and present results. It handles user input parsing, manages the flow of the analysis process, and is responsible for outputting the results in various formats.

The auth-report-spring module contains Spring-specific configurations and adaptations, allowing the core module to work seamlessly with Spring applications. It provides implementations of core interfaces that are specific to Spring, such as specialized scanners for detecting Spring controllers and analyzers for Spring Security configurations.

### 4.2.2 Key Components

### 4.2.3 Design Patterns and Principles

The Authorization Report Tool's design incorporates several established design patterns and adheres to SOLID principles to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

#### Applied Design Patterns

1. Visitor Pattern: The SecurityConfigAnalyzer employs the Visitor pattern to traverse and analyze the structure of Spring Security configurations. This pattern allows for separation of the algorithm from the object structure it operates on, enabling easy addition of new analysis techniques without modifying the existing classes.

2. Strategy Pattern: The ReportPrinter uses the Strategy pattern to handle different output formats (text and JSON). This allows for easy extension to support additional output formats in the future.

3. Factory Method Pattern: The creation of specific analyzer components is managed through factory methods, allowing for flexibility in instantiating different types of analyzers based on the context.

#### SOLID Principles Application

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class within the modules has a single, well-defined responsibility. For example, in the auth-report-cli module, CommandLineOptions is solely responsible for handling command-line arguments, while ReportPrinter focuses on output formatting.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The modular design allows for extension without modification. For instance, new security feature detectors can be added to the SecurityConfigAnalyzer in the auth-report-core module without changing existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Different types of reports (e.g., AuthorizationReport, DifferentialReport) can be used interchangeably where a report type is expected.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Interfaces are kept focused and minimal. For example, in the auth-report-core module, separate interfaces might be defined for scanning, analyzing, and reporting functionalities.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules (like those in auth-report-cli) depend on abstractions from auth-report-core, not on concrete implementations, allowing for flexibility and easier testing.

### 4.4.2 Key Algorithms

#### Endpoint Discovery Algorithm

The endpoint discovery algorithm in the AuthorizationScanner class uses reflection to discover Spring controller classes and their methods. The algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Package Scanning: Using reflection, the algorithm scans the specified base package for classes annotated with `@RestController` or `@Controller`.
2. Method Analysis: For each controller class, the algorithm examines its methods for mapping annotations such as `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
3. Path Construction: The algorithm constructs the full path for each endpoint by combining the class-level mapping (if any) with the method-level mapping.
4. Metadata Extraction: Additional metadata such as HTTP method and any method-level security annotations (e.g., `@PreAuthorize`) are extracted.

This algorithm's efficiency is critical as it sets the foundation for the entire analysis process. Care was taken to optimize the reflection operations to minimize the performance impact on large codebases.

#### Security Configuration Analysis Algorithm

The security configuration analysis algorithm, implemented in the SecurityConfigAnalyzer, is designed to interpret the Spring Security configuration. The key steps include:
